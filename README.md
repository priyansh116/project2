# newproject
 this project wae created form local system.

 in this git push origin main directory not work

 first we have to convert project2 folder into repo using =>git init
 we have to create project2 repo into git and copy its link

 then we connect local repo from our vscode(project2) with git remote repo project2 
 using=>git remote add origin  <link(http)>
 
 git remote -v(to verify remote)
 git branch(to check branch)
 git branch -M main(to rename branch to main if needed)
   
 then after we use git push  origin main
